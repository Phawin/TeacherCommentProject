Kendrick continues to do just fine in Algebra 2. Kendrick has not made the changes I suggested last semester. He should attempt to make these changes in the future to further his academic career. He works well with other students, he is an attentive student, and he is an active participant in class. He earned 64% on the final assessment. Kendrick tries his hardest, but struggles to grasp some of the topics we covered. His grade for the semester is a C-.
