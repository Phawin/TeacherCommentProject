Selin continues to do excellent work in AP BC Calculus. Selin did not need to make changes from last semester and continues to show success. She works well with other students, she is an engaged student, and her homework is well written. On the skydiving project, Selin earned 100%. She earned 99% on the final assessment. Selin's mathematical skills continue to impress me. Her grade for the semester is an A.
